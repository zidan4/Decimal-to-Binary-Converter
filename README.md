# Decimal-to-Binary-Converter


freeCodeCamp Practice Project.


JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures.





Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself. This can reduce a complex problem into simpler sub-problems, until they become straightforward to solve.

In this project, I've learnt how to build a decimal-to-binary converter using JavaScript. I learn the fundamental concepts of recursion, explore the call stack, and build out a visual representation of the recursion process through an animation.
